# Intro to OpenCV

This repository contains tutorials, code examples, and sample projects to help users explore the basics and advanced features of OpenCV for image and video processing. It is structured into two main sections: OpenCV Labs and Sample Projects.

## Directory Structure

### 1. OpenCV Labs
A collection of foundational tutorials to get started with OpenCV:
- **01_getting_started_with_images.py**: Learn how to load, display, and save images.
- **02_basic_image_manipulations_crop_resize_flip_and_modify_pixels.py**: Explore basic image operations like cropping, resizing, flipping, and pixel manipulation.
- **03_annotating_images.py**: Draw shapes, lines, and add text to images.
- **04_basic_image_enhancement_mathematical_operations.py**: Apply mathematical operations for image enhancement.
- **05_accessing_camera.py**: Capture video from your webcam using OpenCV.
- **06_writing_video_using_opencv.py**: Record video to a file using OpenCV.
- **07_Image_filtering.py**: Implement basic image filtering techniques.
- **08_image_alignment.py**: Align images to create consistent viewpoints.
- **09_panorama.py**: Stitch images together to create panoramas.
- **10_hdr.py**: Create high dynamic range (HDR) images.
- **11_objecttracking.py**: Basic object tracking implementation.
- **12_facedetection.py**: Detect faces in images using OpenCV.
- **13_tf_object_detection.py**: Use TensorFlow for object detection.
- **14_openpose.py**: Implement human pose detection.

### 2. Sample Projects
Explore various real-world applications of OpenCV:
- **Attendance Detector**: A project for detecting and marking attendance using images.
- **Drawboard using openCV**: A virtual drawboard built with OpenCV.
- **Hand gesture number recognition**: Recognize hand gestures to count numbers.
- **Hand Tracking Example**: A simple example of tracking hand movements.
- **Volume controller**: Control the system volume based on hand gestures.
